# Lib

Lib.py
The main program reads the data in account.txt, liibrary.txt, menu.txt, and tran_system.txt, then displays or modifies the data in these files according to the functional requirements.

account.txt
This is a simple simulation of the storage file for accounts and passwords. All accounts and passwords are stored as "account password". This file is used for security systems. If the data is not stored, login will not be allowed.

library.txt
This is a simple simulation of a library room. All information is saved as "Room Name | Reservation Status | Reservation Person | Reservation Expiration Time". All information will be displayed or modified according to 
the needs of the main program. The reservation system's implementation mainly depends on modifying this file.

menu.txt
A simple simulation of a menu file, which records the cafeteria information.

tran_system.txt
A simple simulation of a public transportation system file records public transportation system information.
